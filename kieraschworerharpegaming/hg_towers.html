        <h2>Rule and Ancient City</h2>
      
          <p><b>Towers and Temples</b> is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
              Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
              Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
              Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
              the administration of a city. Each role provides 
              a different ability and strategy. However, 
              one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
              must be constantly aware of betrayal 
              and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
              of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
              and expansion packs available for larger parties.<br></p>
              
              <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
                  carefully choose his or her roles and 
                  the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
                  of a card. However the level of randomness is 
                  just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
                  overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
                  recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
                  players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
                  and some of the game appeal.<br></p>

      <h2>Highly Recommended</h2>
      
      <p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
            just about perfect and each player must 
            carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
            strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
            the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
            high and gets even better when you replace 
            some of the cards with new cards available in the 
            expansion packs.<br></p>

        <h2>Great Strategic Board Game</h2>
      
        <p>We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
            to 6 players and we can strongly 
            recommend the game. The different phases of the 
            game are interesting and intriguing, from
            bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
            With the variety of cards and 
            scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
            a great introduction to the world of 
            strategic board games and role playing.<br></p>

            <h2>An Incredible Game</h2>
      
            <p>The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
                and one of the best around. As 
                for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
                are tough decisions to make every 
                turn. It's not only important to select the character 
                that increases your chances for scoring, 
                but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
                are likely to select, and then hedge against 
                their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
                and deep strategic thinking. However, 
                it can still be played at a more basic level for 
                younger users.<br></p>
        
                <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
                    <i>Best in its Class.</i> Highly recommended.<br></p>
